## Changes made August 7, 2020

### Site-wide enhancements

- All ATP references from USAJOBS and Open Opportunities have been removed as ATP is going to streamline its own Authentication Process (coming soon!)
- Campaign enhancements - Require all campaigns to have at least 1 member assigned to it

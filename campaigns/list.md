title: What is a list?
---

A list is a smaller collection of job seekers within a campaign. Lists can help you manage a large number of potential job seekers. You can:

* Create as many lists as you need.
* Name the list whatever you want to fit your workflow. 
* Add job seekers to a list and delete them too. 
* Move a job seeker from one list to another within the same campaign.

You can use lists to organize job seekers by:

* Job title
* Hiring authority
* GS level
* Events
* Status (for example: no response, declined, interested, documents requested)
* Workflow

When you share a campaign with another user, you will also share the lists within that campaign.

Here are a few ways you can use lists to organize campaigns.

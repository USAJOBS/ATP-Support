title: What is a list?
---

A list is a smaller collection of job seekers within a campaign. Lists can help you manage a large number of potential job seekers. You can name and organize lists by date, job title, or different stages of a workflow. For example, you can create a list of job seekers you want to invite to an event, or a list of job seekers who responded back to you. When you share a campaign with another user, you will also share the lists within that campaign.

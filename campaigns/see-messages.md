You can see all your sent and draft messages within a campaign.

1. Go to your **Campaigns** section.
2. Click the campaign you’re interested in.
3. Click **Messaging** in the top navigation.

You will see options for **New message**, **Draft** and **Sent**. You may see a number next to **Draft** or **Sent**—this tells you how many messages you have in each category.

Click **Drafts** or **Sent** to see your message(s).

title: How to archive a campaign
---

You can archive a campaign if you are no longer using it or want to move it out of your active view. Archiving a campaign does not delete it, but will move it to an **Archived** tab so you will not see it when you are in the **Active** campaigns tab.  You can also unarchive a campaign.

To archive a campaign:

1. Go to the **Campaigns** section—make sure you’re looking at your active campaigns.
2. Go to the campaign you want to archive.
3. Click **Archive** in the right corner.

You can also archive within a campaign you’re viewing. Click the ellipsis menu in the top right corner of the campaign heading area and click **Archive campaign**.

To unarchive a campaign:

1. Go to the **Campaigns** section.
2. Click the **Archived** tab.
3. Go to the campaign you want to unarchive.
4. Click **Activate** in the right corner.

You can also unarchive within a campaign you’re viewing. Click the ellipse menu in the top right corner of the campaign heading area and click **Activate campaign**.

title: What is the messaging feature?
---

The messaging feature lets you email job seekers and potential job candidates from a campaign within ATP.

When you add job seekers to a campaign, you can message them and invite them to:

* Apply for jobs.
* Attend upcoming events.
* Be considered for non-competitive or direct hire positions.

## Why should I use messaging?
Messaging helps your recruiting efforts by offering a secure way to contact job seekers that you may be interested in. The messaging feature safeguards job seekers email addresses and phone numbers. It also offers a way for job seekers to respond back to you.

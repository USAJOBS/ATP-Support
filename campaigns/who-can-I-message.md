* Individual candidates within your campaign.

Learn how to create and send a message.

## Is there a limit to how many messages I can send?
No, there is no limit to the number of messages you can send.  We recommend you only message candidates as needed, to avoid appearing as spam.

## Can candidates reply to messages?
Yes. Candidates can reply to any message you send through ATP, however the reply will go to the email address that was listed in the **Reply to** line of the message. We do not track or manage incoming messages in ATP.

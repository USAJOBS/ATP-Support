title: How do I save job seekers to campaigns?
---

You can always find job seekers by conducting a search and then clicking on the job seeker’s name to go to their user detail page. This page will show you more information about the job seeker you are interested in, including their resume. You’ll see an “Add to Campaign” button that will allow you to save the job seeker to any campaign you’d like, or create a new campaign to add them to.

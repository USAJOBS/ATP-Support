title: What is the Pathways Internship Talent Program?
---

Students participating in the Pathways Internship Program who have met all performance and training requirements canâ€™t always be converted to positions at their agencies. The Pathways Internship Talent Program connects these interns with open jobs at other agencies.  Any agency may use this talent program to recruit interns for permanent and term jobs.

Agencies that do not currently participate in the Pathways Internship Program or do not fill positions in the competitive service are eligible for this talent program but should email [pathways@opm.gov](mailto:pathways@opm.gov) for more information before starting.

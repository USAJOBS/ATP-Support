title: How can my agency use this talent program?
---

Found in the Agency Talent Portal under Talent Programs, the Pathways Internship Talent Program features a searchable list of interns that includes the following details: 
* Name 
* Location 
* Education 
* Agency contact details 
* Conversion eligibility end date 

You can use this information to search for and convert interns from this talent program under non-competitive eligibilities.

Be aware that interns in this talent program must be converted within 120 days of their degree completion date. Beyond this date, their eligibility for conversion via this talent program expires.

The Pathways Program Officer (PPO) can also invite interns that your agency cannot convert to this talent program. Interns have 60 days to respond to this invitation. If they do not respond within this timeframe, they will lose access to the talent program, and must be re-invite to the program if they wish to participate.

Your agencyâ€™s PPO should track these deadlines and communicate with interns in this talent program to make sure they understand all program due dates and requirements.

For more help converting interns via this talent program, please email [pathways@opm.gov](mailto:pathways@opm.ogv).

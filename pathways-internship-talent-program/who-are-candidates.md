title: Who are the candidates in this talent program?
---

Candidates in this talent program are current students who have successfully completed an internship at a federal agency as part of the Pathways Internship Program. These candidates must maintain good academic standing and have completed 640 hours of federal work (320 hours if they receive a waiver) as part of their internship.

Interns can be converted only after the successful completion of their internship program and all related training and educational requirements. Your agency must still verify the intern's eligibility and qualifications before offering a position.

title: What is an agency administrator?
---

An agency that uses ATP usually has an agency administrator, who manages user access to ATP. There may be more than one agency administrator, depending on an agency’s size. 

### Agency administrators:

* Add new users.
* Reactivate users with locked accounts.
* Encourage use of ATP.
* Train users.
* Help USAJOBS decide on new product features.

While ATP is available to the entire federal recruitment community, your agency may have additional restrictions and limit who can get an account.

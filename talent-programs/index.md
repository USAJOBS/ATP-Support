title: What is a talent program?
---

A talent program is a recruitment program that connects vetted job candidates with federal agencies that are hiring.

Candidates in each talent program have participated in a federal program, such as an internship, that has vetted their eligibilities and qualifications. These candidates arenâ€™t on an active hiring certificate but may be available to hire under non-competitive eligibilities.

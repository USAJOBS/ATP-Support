title: What is Section 508 in the Agency Talent Portal?
---

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that members of the public with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to members of the public without disabilities, unless fulfilling that requirement would impose an undue burden.

We comply with the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 794) and the accessibility standards issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. For websites, at a minimum, we use the Web Content Accessibility Standards (WCAG) version 2.0, levels A and AA. As we update our websites, we consider additional WCAG success criteria and best practices.

For more information about the program, please read our [Section 508 policy](https://www.opm.gov/information-management/accessibility/OPMSection508Policy2021.pdf).

### Contact us

If you have questions or feedback about Section 508 and digital accessibility within the Agency Talent Portal, email us at [recruiter-help@usajobs.gov](mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov). Information you submit goes to the Agency Talent Portal Help Desk for review.

### How to submit a section 508 complaint

**If you are an OPM employee** and believe you have been discriminated against on the basis of disability, contact an OPM Equal employment Opportunity counselor within 45 days. If your complaint is about a personnel action, then count from the effective date of the action. The counselor will walk you through the process of filing an informal complaint, which can be followed with a formal complaint.

Learn more about the [EEO complaint process](https://www.eeoc.gov/federal-sector/overview-federal-sector-eeo-complaint-process) from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

**If you are not an OPM employee and your complaint is not about OPM**, please contact the agency in question.

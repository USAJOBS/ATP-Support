title: How do I use ATP?
---

<p class="usa-font-lead usajobs-openopps-help-center__lead">
  ATP has been redesigned to support multiple workflows and to embrace
  integrated features as they become available.
</p>

<h3>Resume Mining</h3>
<p>
  ATP’s most used feature is Resume Mining, which allows HR users and hiring
  managers to discover qualified job seekers who have made their resumes
  searchable in their USAJOBS account. Resume Mining can be accessed from
  anywhere in ATP by clicking the “Search” button. You can start by:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Searching nearly one million up-to-date resumes
  </li>
  <li>
    Finding interesting job seekers
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating a campaign from the search results
  </li>
  <li>
    Then, sharing the campaign with your recruitment team
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Or you can create a campaign, add your colleagues, establish a framework for
  reviewing job seekers, and then search for talent. The choice of method is up
  to you and your recruitment team.
</p>
<h3>Campaigns</h3>
<p>
  Campaigns are a new feature which allows for recruitment teams to share lists
  of job seekers and collaborate together when reviewing job seekers.

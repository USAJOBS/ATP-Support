title: What is the Agency Talent Portal?
---


<p>
The Agency Talent Portal (ATP) offers targeted recruitment services to help recruiters, HR specialists and hiring managers discover highly-skilled talent. With ATP, you can create and collaborate on recruitment campaigns, search over 1.5 million resumes, and create career-related events to post on USAJOBS.</p> 
<p>
ATP is not a hiring tool. You must follow Merit System principles, and any other applicable laws or policies before making a job offer.

title: Why do job seeker resumes expire?
---

Job seekers have to actively choose to make their resumes searchable within USAJOBS in order to be active ATP job seekers. This is why not all USAJOBS account holders are ATP job seekers. Job seekers with expired resumes may have forgotten to make their resumes searchable, or it is possible their searchable resumes may have expired. Searchable resumes expire every 18 months.

For now, ATP does not display expired resumes, so you might see job seekers there one day, and gone the next. We are working on a way to show you whose resumes are no longer available in your campaigns and lists so you can keep track of the job seekers you are interested in.

title: Why should I use a talent pool?
---

Using talent pools streamlines the federal hiring process by facilitating the use of shared hiring certificates. Talent pools give you and your agency access to qualified candidates who are already on an approved hiring certificate and interested in similar jobs at any agency. You can quickly review their resumes  and speed up the hiring process if the hiring certificate matches your open position(s). 

 

If you want to hire a candidate from the talent pool, you must complete the hire using your talent acquisition system. [Learn more about using a talent pool](how-can-agency-use).

title: Are there specific hiring rules and guidelines for using a talent pool?
---

Yes. To create a talent pool or hire from a talent pool, you must meet and follow specific shared certificate hiring guidelines. [Read these FAQs about hiring off a shared certificate](https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/Competitive%20Service%20Act%20-%20Shared%20Certificates%20Q%26As.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

Additionally, each talent acquisition system (TAS) has their own guidelines on how to complete a hire using a shared certificate.  

[Read the Monster shared certificate guidelines](https://www.monstergovernmentsolutions.com/docs/release-notes/Shared-Certificate-Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

If your agency uses a different TAS, please contact your TAS for questions about any specific guidelines.

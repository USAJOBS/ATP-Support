title: Who can use talent pools?
---

To use talent pools, you must have an ATP account and one of the following roles:   

## Agency administrator or agency general user

As an agency administrator or general user, you can use talent pools to contact and hire candidates for any open position if the position matches the hiring certificate associated with the talent pool. 
 
## Talent pool manager

If you have this role, you can create and share talent pools. 

## Shared certificate coordinator

If you have this role, you are responsible for managing the candidate list in the talent pool. You can: 

* Copy a talent pool that matches the hiring needs of your agency.
* Contact each candidate on the list to confirm if they are interested in positions at your agency.
* Share the list of candidates with your agency's HR staff.
* Update the list based on who is selected or declined.

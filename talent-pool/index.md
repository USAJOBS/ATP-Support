title: What is a talent pool?
---

A talent pool is a list of qualified candidates who are already on an approved shared hiring certificate and ready to be hired. These candidates have opted-in to sharing their federal application with other federal agencies who are hiring for similar positions. You can use talent pools to find candidates that fit your hiring need.

title: How can my agency use talent pools?
---

Talent pools offer agencies an easy way to access shared hiring certificates that fall under the Competitive Service Act (CSA). Under the CSA, an agency may share a competitive certificate issued under delegated examining procedures with one or more agencies for a position that is in the same occupational series, grade level (or equivalent), full performance level, and duty location. 

Each talent pool includes the following details: 

* Job announcement number
* Series
* Grade
* Promotion potential
* Location 

Each talent pool has a list of candidates that are qualified and approved for hiring based on the above details. You can use the talent pool if your agency is hiring for a position that has the same series, grade, promotion potential and location.  

If you want to hire a candidate listed on a talent pool, you must complete the hire using your talent acquisition system.

title: How can I become a talent pool manager or shared certificate coordinator?
---

You must already have an ATP account to become a talent pool manager or shared certificate coordinator. If you do have an account, you can email the USAJOBS help desk at recruiter-help@usajosb.gov to request one of these roles. Both roles require training before you can start using them.

title: Which web browsers work best with ATP?
---
We support the current and prior major releases of:

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/){:target="_blank"}
* [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/){:target="_blank"}
* [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/){:target="_blank"}
* [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge){:target="_blank"}

We no longer support Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE). You will not be able to use ATP on IE.

## Should I upgrade my browser?
Itâ€™s best to keep your browsers up-to-date. Newer browsers are:
 * More secure.
 * Faster at loading pages.
 * Less likely to crash.
 * Able to automatically update to the latest version or notify you that an update is available.
 * Offer better protection against viruses, spyware, malware, and other security issues.

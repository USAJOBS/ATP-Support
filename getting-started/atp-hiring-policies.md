title: How does Agency Talent Portal work with hiring policies?
---

ATP's resume search is aligned with federal hiring and recruitment policies. Job seekers must opt-in to make their resumes available within their USAJOBS profile. If you find a job seeker youâ€™re interested in, you and your recruitment team must still follow Merit System principles, and any other applicable laws or policies before making a job offer. ATP is not a replacement for current federal hiring and application processes.

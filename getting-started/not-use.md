title: How should I not use ATP?
---

ATP is a recruitment tool; it is not a hiring tool. Merit system principles, as well as any applicable other laws and policies, must be followed. Just like normal, you cannot search for job seekers and bypass the application process. In the event that you are doing a direct hire through a special hiring authority, it is important to obtain Qualifications from HR before making job offers.

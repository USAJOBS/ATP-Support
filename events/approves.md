title: How long does it take to approve and post an event?
---

Once you submit an event, a USAJOBS program office team member will review and approve it. The program office will contact you within three business days if there are questions or edits. 

The event request process takes a few days. You must submit an event for review two weeks before you want it to appear on the USAJOBS website.

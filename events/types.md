You can create in-person or virtual events that support federal hiring, including:

* Hiring workshops 
* Information sessions 
* Job fairs 
* Training events 
* Agency branded events 
* Hard-to-fill position information sessions: This might be a position you had to announce more than once to find qualified candidates because of the job location or duties.
* Large-scale recruiting or hiring initiatives.

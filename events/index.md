title: What are events?
---

A recruitment event, such as a job fair, career expo, career fair, or hiring event, is held by employers, schools or recruiters and offers on-the-spot interviews and information about the employer or job to interested job seekers.

You can use the event feature in ATP to advertise recruitment and other career-related events on USAJOBS. 

### What kind of events can I create?

You can create in-person or virtual events that support federal hiring, such as:

* Hiring workshops
* Job fairs
* Information sessions
* Training

**All events must be**:

* Hosted by a federal agency.
* Support federal hiring.
* Be open to a broad and large group.

USAJOBS will not post any event for a private company or any event that is only open to small group of people or a specific career field.  USAJOBS gets over a million visits to the site each week.  Advertising a small event will likely result in ineligible participants. 

For example, we can’t post an event for a private company, such as the Miami Boat Show. But we can say:

**Event title**: OPM Hiring Fair<br/>
**Event description**: See our recruiters at the Miami Boat Show.

### Where do events display?

Approved events display on the [USAJOBS’ events page](https://www.usajobs.gov/Notification/Events){:target="_blank"} and will display until the event is over.

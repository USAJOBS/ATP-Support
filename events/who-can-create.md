Federal agency HR professionals and hiring managers who serve as ATP Agency Admins, general users, and event users may create and post events on USAJOBS. You also need an Agency Talent Portal account. To get an ATP account, please email recruiter-help@usajobs.gov. You will receive an email to your federal email address with a link to create your account.

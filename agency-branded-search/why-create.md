title: Why create an agency branded search page?
---

Agency-branded search pages can enhance your agency’s recruitment efforts. 

You can use the agency-branded search page to:

* Point job seekers to your agency’s open job opportunities while using the positive USAJOBS search and apply experience. 
* Tailor and predefine the search filters to display all your agency’s job announcements or a smaller subset to support a specific hiring initiative.
* Advertise specific types of jobs to specific groups of job seekers, such as veterans, individuals with disabilities and students and recent graduates.

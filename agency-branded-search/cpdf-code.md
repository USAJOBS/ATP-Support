title: What is a CPDF code?
---

This is a code that organizes jobs on USAJOBS.gov and makes sure they show up under the correct department, agency or sub agency. The code is added when a job announcement is created.

## What if my agency doesn’t have a unique CPDF code? 
If your agency doesn’t have a unique CPDF code, you can still create a branded search page that will display the jobs from your office using custom mission-critical occupation (MCO) tags. Work with your Talent Acquisition System (TAS) partner to create this tag. 

Once your TAS creates the tag, you will add the tag to your job announcements. When you create your branded search page, you can add a filter for this specific tag. Only jobs with that custom MCO tag will appear on the branded search page.

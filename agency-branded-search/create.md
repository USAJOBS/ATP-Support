## 1. Send a request to become a **Talent Manager**

* Email [recruiter-help@usajobs.gov](mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov) to request the **Talent Manager** role.
* Make sure the agency where you currently work is listed in your ATP account.  Sign into ATP and go to **My account** to see your agency.
* Include in your request if the agency listed in your account is incorrect or if you need to update it to a sub-element of your organization.

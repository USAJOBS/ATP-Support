To create an agency-branded search page you must have an active ATP account. If you need an account, email recruiter-help@usajobs.gov.


1. Send a request to recruiter-help@usajobs.gov to become a **Talent Manager** in ATP.
   1.  Make sure the agency where you currently work is listed in your ATP account.  Check this by signing into ATP and going to **My account**.
   2.  Include in your request if the agency is incorrect or if you need to update it to a sub-element of your organization.

2. Create a banner that will appear at the top of your agency-branded search page. 
   1. The banner must be a .jpg, .png, .gif, or .webp with a maximum image height is 250px or 125px if made in Illustrator. There is no recommended width, however standard resolution is 1366px. 

3. Send a request to recruiter-help@usajobs.gov to create a URL for your agency-branded search page. 
   1. You can request a customized URL for your page (i.e. vetjobs.usajobs.gov).
   2. All URLS will end in usajobs.gov.
   3. Once you create a URL, you canâ€™t change it. 

4. Sign into ATP and create your agency-branded search page. 
   1. Go to the **Agency-branded search** section.
   2. Add your banner.
   3. Choose the filters you would like to appear on your page.

title: What is a branded search page?
---

A branded search page is a customizable job search page that lists only your agencyâ€™s open job announcements. Branded search pages have a unique URL that your agency can share with job seekers or specific talent pools. 

With a branded search page, you can tailor the USAJOBS search feature by selecting and predefining the search filters that matter most to your agency's hiring needs.

## Can my agency have more than one branded search page? 

Yes. Agencies can have many branded search pages with their own unique URL. We recommend you only create a branded search page if it will regularly have jobs appear on the page.

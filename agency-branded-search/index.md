title: What is an agency-branded search page?
---

An agency-branded search page is a customizable job search page that lists only your agencyâ€™s open job announcements. Agency-branded search pages have a unique URL that your agency can share with job seekers or specific talent pools. 

With an agency-branded search page, you can tailor the USAJOBS search feature by selecting and predefining the search filters that matter most to your agency's hiring needs.

## Can my agency have more than one agency-branded search page? 

Yes. Agencies can have many agency-branded search pages with their own unique URL. We recommend you only create an agency-branded search page if it will regularly have jobs appear on the page.

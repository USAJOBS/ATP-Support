title: What is a branded search page?
---

A branded search page is a customizable job search page that lists only your agency’s open job announcements. Branded search pages have a unique URL that your agency can share with job seekers or specific talent pools. 

With a branded search page, you can tailor the USAJOBS search feature by selecting and predefining the search filters that matter most to your agency's hiring needs.

## Why should my agency create a branded search page?

Branded search pages can enhance your agency’s recruitment efforts. You can use the branded search page to:

* Point job seekers to your agency’s open job opportunities while using the positive USAJOBS search and apply experience.
* Tailor and predefine the search filters to display all your agency’s job announcements or a smaller subset to support a specific hiring initiative.
* Advertise specific types of jobs to specific groups of job seekers, such as veterans, individuals with disabilities and students and recent graduates.

## Can my agency have more than one branded search page? 

Yes. Agencies can have many branded search pages with their own unique URL. We recommend you only create a branded search page if it will regularly have jobs appear on the page.

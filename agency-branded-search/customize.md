title: How can I customize my agencyâ€™s branded search page?
---

You can include a banner that will appear at the top of your agency-branded search page and can also create filters that appear on the page. For example, you can create a page that only shows jobs open to veterans and include a filter for GS level, location and salary.  

## What size should the banner be? 

The banner must be a .jpg, .png, .gif, or .webp with a maximum image height is 250px or 125px if made in Illustrator. There is no recommended width, however standard resolution is 1366px. 

## Can I imbed a video into the agency-branded search page? 

Imbedding videos is currently not available, but we may consider this for a future enhancement.

title: Who can create or edit a branded search pages?
---
You must have **branded search manager** access in ATP to create or edit a branded search page. The USAJOBS program office is responsible for granting this access. We recommend this role is reserved for individuals who support hiring and recruitment initiatives within their agency and are not already designated as an agency administrator within ATP.

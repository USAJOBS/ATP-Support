title: Who can create or edit agency-branded search pages?
---
You must have **Talent manager** access in ATP to create or edit an agency-branded search page. The USAJOBS program office is responsible for granting talent manager access, and we recommend this access is reserved for individuals who support hiring and recruitment initiatives within their agency and are not already designated as an agency administrator within ATP.

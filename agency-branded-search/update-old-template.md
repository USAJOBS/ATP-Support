title: What if my agency has an agency-branded search page using the old template?
---

You can update an older version of an agency-branded search page to the new template, if you have the **Talent Manager** role within ATP. Contact recruiter-help@usajobs.gov to request the Talent Manager role.

Once you have the Talent Manager role, go into your old agency-branded search page and make a change. Once you update it, the page URL will be replaced with the new template. This change is permanent.

title: How do filters work?
---
You can add filters to your agency-branded search pages to let job seekers narrow the job results on the page. 

## Add filters
To add filters, select the check box next to each filter you want to appear on the page. For example, you can select the **Hiring path** filter and nothing else. All of the hiring path filters will appear on your page and the job seeker can further refine the results by each one.

## Predefine filters
You can also predefine the filter values that will appear by selecting the checkbox next to a filter and selecting specific filter values. For example, you can select the **Hiring path** filter and then select the **Veterans** hiring path filter. Only the Veterans filter will appear, preselected, on your agency-branded search page. Job seekers will not be able to change predefined filter options.

## Why is my ATP account locked?

We lock accounts because it’s a security requirement since ATP offers access to resumes and personal information. We lock accounts after: 

* 35 days of inactivity; 
* Not changing a password after 90 days. 

We’ll send you an email if your account is nearing the lockout timeframe. The email will offer steps to prevent a lockout.

## How do I unlock my account?

There are a couple of self-service ways to unlock your account.

1. If you sign into ATP using your correct credentials, and your account is locked, you will see an alert with a link to unlock your account. Click the link and follow the steps to verify the federal email address associated with your ATP account. 
2. If you use an email and password to sign in, click the **Forgot password or need to reset it?** link at the bottom of the email and password sign in screen. By resetting your ATP password, you will unlock your account, even if it was due to inactivity.

## Why is my ATP account locked?

We lock accounts after 35 days of inactivity. We lock accounts because it’s a security requirement since ATP offers access to resumes and personal information. 
We’ll send you an email if your account is nearing the lockout timeframe. The email will offer steps to prevent a lockout.


## How do I unlock my account?

There are two ways to unlock your account.

**Using your PIV or CAC card**

If you sign into ATP using your PIV or CAC card, you will see an alert with a link to unlock your account. Click the link and follow the steps to unlock your account. 

**Using Login.gov**

If you use Login.gov to sign into ATP, you must send an email to recruiter-help@usajobs.gov requesting to unlock your account.

title: How to reset your password
---

If you forgot your password or your account is locked because of too many incorrect sign in attempts, you can reset your password from the **Sign in** page.

1. Click **Use my Agency Talent Portal** account on the ATP sign in page.
2. Click **Forgot your password or need to reset it?**
3. Enter your federal email address in the text box.
4. Go to your federal email inbox and look for the ATP reset password email.
5. Click the link in the email to reset your password.

You need to change your password every 90 days. If you sign in with a USA Staffing account or PIV/CAC card, you donâ€™t need to update your password every 90 days.

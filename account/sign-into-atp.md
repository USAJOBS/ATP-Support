Once you have an ATP account, there are three ways to sign in:

## Use my USA Staffing account
Use this option if you’re an HR Specialist with a USA Staffing account. You can sign in with your USA Staffing email and password or PIV card. Hiring managers with Staffing accounts must sign in using their PIV or CAC card or their Login.gov account.

## Use my PIV/CAC card
Use this option if you have a PIV or CAC card (not a temporary card). If this is your first time signing in, you’ll need to register your PIV card. Follow the prompts after you click **Use my PIV/CAC card**.

**What if I have a temporary PIV?**

You can't use a temporary PIV to sign into ATP. You must use Login.gov. Follow the steps under **I don’t have a PIV/CAC card or a USA Staffing account**. Once you receive a permanent card, you can sign in using your PIV or CAC.

## I don’t have a PIV/CAC card or a USA Staffing account
If you don’t have a PIV/CAC card or a USA Staffing account, or you have a temporary PIV card, you must use Login.gov to sign into ATP. Click **I don’t have a PIV/CAC card or USA Staffing account**. You will have three options to sign in with Login.gov:

### Have a Login.gov account that uses your federal email address?

Use this option if you already have a Login.gov account that uses your federal email address. When you go to Login.gov, you must enter your federal email address when you sign in and then you’ll automatically return to and have access to ATP.

### Have a Login.gov account that uses a non-federal email address?

Use this option if you already have a Login.gov account, but it uses a non-federal email address (such as a personal gmail.com address). When you go to Login.gov, you need to add your federal email address to your account. Follow these steps after you click **Add my federal email**:

1.	Sign into Login.gov—you’ll go to your account page.
2.	Click **Add new email**.
3.	Enter your federal email address.
4.	Follow Login.gov’s steps to confirm your email address.
5.	Return to ATP and click **Have a Login.gov account that uses a federal email address**.
6.	Sign into Login.gov (using your federal email address)—you’ll automatically return to and be signed into ATP.

### Don’t have a Login.gov account?

Use this option if you don’t have an existing Login.gov account. You will go to Login.gov and you need to create an account. Make sure you enter your federal email address when you create your account.  Once you create your account you’ll automatically return to ATP.

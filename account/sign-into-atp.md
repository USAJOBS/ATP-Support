Once you have an ATP account, there are three ways to sign in:

**Use my USA Staffing account**–Use this option if you’re an HR Specialist with a USA Staffing account. You can sign in with your USA Staffing email and password or PIV card. Hiring managers with Staffing accounts will have to use their PIV/CAC card or their ATP account.

**Use my PIV/CAC card**–Use this option if you have a PIV or CAC card. If this is your first time signing in, you’ll need to register your PIV card. Follow the prompts after you click Use my PIV/CAC card.

**Use my Agency Talent Portal account**–Use this option if you don’t have a PIV or CAC card.

If you don’t have an account yet, contact your agency administrator or [recruiter-help@usajobs.gov](mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov).

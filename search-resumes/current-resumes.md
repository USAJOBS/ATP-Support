title: How current are the resumes and profiles?
---

A job seeker must choose to make their resume and profile searchable in their USAJOBS profile for it to appear in ATP.  

When a job seeker chooses to make their resume searchable in USAJOBS, it will remain searchable in ATP for 18 months. For example, if a user makes their resume searchable on 4/1/21, it will expire on 10/1/22.

## Do resumes and profiles expire?
Yes. Resumes and profiles expire after 18 months and we will no longer display them in ATP. 
Before the 18 months is up, a job seeker can extend their resume for one more year. For example, if a job seeker extends their resume on 6/1/21, it will now expire on 6/1/22.

## What does the last updated date mean?
The **Last updated date** shows the last time a job seeker has updated their resume or profile.  Even if the job seeker extends for one more year, if they made no changes to their resume or profile, the **Last updated date** will still reflect their original upload date.

## Can a job seeker choose to not be searchable?
Yes. A job seeker can choose to no longer make their profile and resume searchable.  When this happens, we will no longer display them in ATP.

## What if a job seeker is in a campaign and their resume expires?
If a job seeker is in a campaign and their resume expires, or they choose to no longer be searchable, they will remain in the campaign, but you will no longer see the resume.

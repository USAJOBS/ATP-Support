You can print or download certain types of resumes, as well as export lists of job seekers you’ve saved to a campaign. 

### Exporting job seekers to an excel file

To export a list of job seekers, you must first add the job seekers to a campaign.

1. Go to your search results list of job seekers.
2. Click **Save all search results to a campaign**, if you want to save all of the job seekers in your search results (you can save up to 100). Or you can click the name of each job seeker you’re interested in and then click **Add to campaign**.
3. Name your campaign. 
4. Click **Save**.
5. Go to your **Campaigns** section.
6. Click the Campaign name you want to export.
7. Click **Export to Excel**.

### Print or download a resume

You can print directly from ATP any resume built using the USAJOBS resume builder feature. You can also download a resume uploaded by a job seeker, as long as it’s a word doc or PDF file, and then print it from your computer.

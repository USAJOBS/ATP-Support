title: Is the candidate information verified or adjudicated?
---

No. We display the information that is in the job seeker’s USAJOBS profile.  We don’t adjudicate or verify any eligibility information. 

Job seekers have the option to self-select hiring paths in their USAJOBS profile, based on what they think they are eligible for. The hiring specialist will need to confirm eligibility for any preferences or hiring authorities.

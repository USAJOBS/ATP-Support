## Job title

The name of the job.

The job title is the first thing a job seeker will see in the search results. Make sure the job title is easy to understand and descriptive of what the job is.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__myth">
#### Myth: Job announcement titles are dictated by policy and must follow a specific format.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4>Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Policy</h4>
  <p>
    Organizational and functional titles do not replace official position titles, they complement them. Agencies may establish organizational and functional titles for internal administration, program management, or similar purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of organizational titles are branch chief or division chief. Examples of functional titles are chief of network management and director of policy development.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4>Impact</h4>
  <p>
    If job seekers don’t understand the job title, they are less likely to read the job announcement. For example, job titles that use grade levels or series numbers are confusing and can be misleading.
  </p>
  <p>
    Job announcements should include a job title that best describes the position, attracts candidates, and makes the job easier to find. For example, titling a job “Java Developer” instead of “APPSW” makes it easier for job seekers to understand.

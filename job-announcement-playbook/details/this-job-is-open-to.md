lead: This section gives an at-a-glance view of who can apply for the job using hiring paths. To help job seekers quickly identify jobs that match their eligibility status, we have included hiring paths iconography and descriptions into the job announcement. Hiring paths are designed to help both job seekers and federal agencies in the hiring process. 
---
The purpose of the hiring paths is to help agencies describe more specifically who is eligible to apply to a job announcement and what hiring authorities they can use to hire an applicant. 

Hiring paths help **staffing specialists**:
<ul>
  <li>Better show who is eligible to apply to a job.</li>  
  <li>Explain specific hiring authorities used to choose an applicant for the position in a visual way to help applicants understand their eligibility for federal jobs.</li>
  </ul>
  
  Hiring paths help **job seekers**:
  <ul>
  <li>Identify jobs that match their eligibility status.</li> 
  <li>Apply to jobs that match their background and experience.</li>
  </ul>
  
  When used correctly, **hiring paths can**:
  <ul>
  <li>Reduce applicants applying for jobs for which they are ineligible, saving time for both applicants and staffing professionals.</li>
  </ul>

### How to use hiring paths effectively

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
  * When used correctly in a job announcement, hiring paths communicate _who is eligible to apply_ to the job. The hiring path should reflect the hiring authorities used to announce the vacancy.
  * Use the fewest hiring paths possible. 
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Choose a hiring path so that job seekers from specific groups see the job announcement when hiring authorities for those specific groups are not being used.
  * Include information that is not relevant to eligibility. See the prerequisites section for guidance. 
</div>
</div>

#### Examples

Unless you are going to hire based on a veteran’s hiring authority, such as VEOA or VRA, do not use the Veteran hiring path.  

If a job is **Open to the public**, DO NOT select any other hiring paths. The rest are already included in the Open to the public hiring path.

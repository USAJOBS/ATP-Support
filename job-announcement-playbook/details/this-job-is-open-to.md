lead: This section gives an at-a-glance view of who can apply for the job using hiring paths. To help job seekers quickly identify jobs that match their eligibility status, we have included Hiring paths iconography and descriptions into the job announcement. Hiring paths are designed to help both job seekers and federal agencies in the hiring process. 
---
The purpose of the hiring paths is to help agencies describe more specifically who is eligible to apply to a job announcement and what hiring authorities they can use to hire an applicant. 

Hiring paths help **staffing specialists**:
<ul>
  <li>Better show who is eligible to apply to a job opportunity announcement.</li>  
  <li>Explain specific hiring authorities used to choose an applicant for the position in a visual way to help applicants understand their eligibility for federal jobs.</li>
  </ul>
  
  Hiring paths help **job seekers**:
  <ul>
  <li>Identify job announcements that match their eligibility status.</li> 
  <li>Apply to jobs that match their background and experience.</li>
  </ul>
  
  When used correctly, **hiring paths can**:
  <ul>
  <li>Reduce applicants applying for jobs for which they are ineligible, saving time for both applicants and staffing professionals.</li>
  </ul>

**How to update this section**

Use the multi-select hiring path list in your TAS to add a hiring path to your job announcement. The hiring path icons and their text descriptions will appear in the “This job is open to” section based on the options you select. 

**Mapping Who May Apply to the hiring paths**

The table below shows the content you need to use in the Who May Apply section to display the matching hiring path. For example, if you want your job announcement to display “Open to the public”, you must enter “U.S. Citizens” in the **Who May Apply** field. Or, we'll also display **Open to the public**, if you don't enter anything in the **Who May Apply** field.

#### How to use hiring paths effectively

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>
  * When used correctly in a job opportunity announcement, hiring paths communicate who is eligible to apply to the job. The hiring path should reflect the hiring authorities used to announce the vacancy.
  * Use the fewest hiring paths possible. 
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Choose a hiring path so that job seekers from specific groups see the job announcement when hiring authorities for those specific groups are not being used.
  * Include information that is not relevant to eligibility. See the prerequisites section for guidance. 
</div>
</div>

#### Examples

Unless you are going to hire based on a veteran’s hiring authority, such as VEOA or VRA, the Veteran hiring path should not be used. This section includes a chart describing which Hiring paths to use in specific hiring scenarios.  

If a job is Open to the public, DO NOT select any other hiring paths. The rest are already included in the Open to the public hiring path. 


### Second announcement

Use this section when the job is also open in a second job announcement to other hiring paths.

The **Second announcement** section will appear directly below the **This job is open to**.  The **Second announcement** says "This job is also open in another announcement to" and will list the other hiring paths.

Clicking on the link will open a new tab or window, depending on the preference the user set in their browser, with the the full second job announcement.

**NOTE:** This is a new field and may not yet be offered by your Talent Acquisition System (TAS). Work with your vendor in order to be able to use this field.

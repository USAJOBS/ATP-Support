This section helps the job seeker determine whether to apply for the job, so being clear and concise is essential. Read the qualifications from the job seeker perspective and ask these questions:

* Are the qualifications specific? 
* Are they described appropriately at each grade level? 
* Are you using plain and simple language? 

This section will automatically use a bulleted list format for each qualification.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__required-by-usajobs">
  <h4>Required by USAJOBS</h4>
  <p>Yes</p>
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__required-by-policy">
  <h4>Required by policy</h4>

</div>
</div>

<h4><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do</h4>

* Only include content that the job seeker needs.
  * Only include qualifications—don’t include background checks, job locations, etc.
  * Use the language from the [Office of Personnel Management Qualifications Standards Handbook](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/classifying-general-schedule-positions/){:target="\_blank"}, supplemented by the specific education and experience requirements identified for the position.

* Organize the content logically
  * Use clear subheadings to separate qualifications that everyone needs vs. qualifications that are specific to each grade level.
  * Keep sentences short—break qualifications into separate sentences to make it easier to read.

* Write like you’re speaking to the job seeker.
  * Use language the job seeker knows—simpler is better! Refer to the [Plainlanguage.gov](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/){:target="\_blank"} list of simple words and phrases.
  * Use the active voice—the active voice is concise, direct and makes the content easy to understand. An active voice sentence follows this order: subject + verb + object.
  * Use pronouns (i.e. address the audience as “you”, “your”) – this helps personalize the experience.
  * Avoid internal jargon and acronyms—if an acronym is necessary, spell it out the first time you use it. 
  * Use "must" instead of "shall" when qualifications are required. For example, "You must have at least one year of experience.".

<h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do not</h4>

* Use dehumanizing terms like “incumbent”, "selectee", or “candidate”.

  * Write a concise one- or two-sentence summary.
  * Use the position description and job analysis to help write the duties.
  * Use language the job seeker knows and be concise—simpler is better!
  * Avoid internal jargon and acronyms—if an acronym is necessary, spell it out the first time it’s used.

  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Use the job summary to discuss the mission statement of the agency. Agencies may now use the **Learn more about this agency link** to convey details about the agency and link to your careers page.
  * Use dehumanizing terms like “incumbent” or “candidate”.
  * Repeat other sections of the job announcement in the summary section (who may apply, et. al.). Duplicating information does not emphasize that information but clutters the announcement. Duplicated information confuses and overwhelms job seekers.
  * Center paragraphs or provide HTML formatting. This negatively impacts the readability of the job announcement.

## Learn more about this agency link

When a user clicks on the **Learn more about this agency** link, a small window pops up with the agency marketing message. The marketing message appears in the lead paragraph of the agency modal and allows you to communicate the agency’s mission or why the agency is a great place to work.

  * Copy the mission statement of the agency. Job seekers can find that information on your website and many will view your site if they are serious about applying. Also, mission statements often do not convey to an outsider what the agency does. 
  * Summarize the job. That should be done in the Summary section.

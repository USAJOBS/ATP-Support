This section will automatically include the initial paragraph and [Learn more about federal benefits](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/working-in-government/benefits/){:target="\_blank"} link, followed by information that you provide along with a disclaimer explaining that benefits sometimes differ across agencies.


### Agency benefits

This text allows the agency to describe benefits that they offer above and beyond the standard federal government benefits. If your agency has it’s own benefits page, you can add a link to that page.

  * Add a link to your agency's benefits or career page, but make sure the label of the link accurately describes the page. For example, if you only have a benefits page, the link label should say “Learn more about our benefits”.  If you have a benefits and career page together, use “Learn more about our benefits and careers.”

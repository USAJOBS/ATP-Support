<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__myth">
#### Myth: Job announcements must be less than 5 pages when printed

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4>Office of Personnel Management Policy (OPM)</h4>
  <p>
    In 2010, OPM recommended that job announcements keep to five pages, but there is no official policy on job announcement length. 
  </p>
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4>Impact</h4>
  <p>
    We’ve expanded the print version to include all URLs for all links and ensured that all fields now appear in the print version. We have split the display version of the job announcement into smaller chunks.</p>
<p>
This is no reason to expand the length of the job announcement. Our research shows that job seekers spend 106.5 seconds looking at a job announcement. The longer it is, the more difficult it is for the job seeker to identify key details. 
  </p>
</div>

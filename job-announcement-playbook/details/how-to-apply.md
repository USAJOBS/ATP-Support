<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__required-by-usajobs">

### Positions filled statement

Tells the job seeker that the agency has the flexibility to hire additional people beyond the number of vacancies listed in the **Locations** section from the pool of applicants to this announcement. 

## Competitive Service Act (CSA)  

The CSA allows an agency to share a competitive certificate issued under delegated examining procedures with other agencies to hire for a permanent or term position that is in the same occupational series, grade level (or equivalent), full performance level and duty location during the 240-day period beginning on the date that the originating agency issued the certificate of eligibles; not the date when the originating agency issued the certificate to the receiving agency.  

Job announcements used for this purpose must include the following language to take advantage of the CSA guidelines. 

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__suggested-text">
<h5>Suggested text</h5>
After we select a candidate, we may share the remaining list of qualified candidates with other federal agencies. You can opt-in if you want us to share your name, application material and assessment results for similar jobs with other agencies. There is no guarantee of further consideration, and you can continue to explore and apply to other job announcements.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__myth">
#### Myth: Job announcements must be less than 5 pages when printed

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4>Office of Personnel Management Policy (OPM)</h4>
  <p>
    In 2010, OPM recommended that job announcements keep to five pages, but there is no official policy on job announcement length. 
  </p>
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4>Impact</h4>
  <p>
    We’ve expanded the print version to include all URLs for all links and ensured that all fields now appear in the print version. We have split the display version of the job announcement into smaller chunks.</p>
<p>
This is no reason to expand the length of the job announcement. Our research shows that job seekers spend 106.5 seconds looking at a job announcement. The longer it is, the more difficult it is for the job seeker to identify key details. 
  </p>

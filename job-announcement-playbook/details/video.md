Multiple sources for videos are accepted. YouTube is the most frequent site used. These tips will help ensure your videos are visible to job seekers.  

## How to embed videos 

Here are two tips on how to embed videos for display: 

1. You cannot copy the YouTube URL and put it into the job announcement. Based on the instructions YouTube provides in their help center (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en) you must select the embed option to get the correct URL. If you are unsure of how to do this, the help link provided will explain. 
2. YouTube does not use http in their URLs, and instead use HTTPS. If you use the incorrect link, your embedded video will not display.

### Example 

* For our job announcement, we want to add the video located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gih8-cwTCQU. But, to get the correct URL, we’ll need to click the share icon, and then click the embed option. This shows us the full embed information for that video, but we only need to copy https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gih8-cwTCQU and paste that into the video section of our job announcement. 
* When the job gets posted, potential applicants will be able to watch the desired video without having to leave the job announcement. As you’ll notice, the specific code for our video does not change, so if desired, you can simply use the beginning URL portion of https://www.youtube.com/embed/ and then add the specific code for your video.

## Actions 

Located above the **Overview**, this section includes an **Apply** button that will start the application process.   

The actions section also includes controls for: 
* Print 
* Save 
* Share 
   
## Job status
Indicates where the job announcement is in the hiring process for job seekers. Includes one of the options:  

<ul>
  <li>Accepting applications</li>
  <li>Reviewing applications</li>
  <li>Hiring complete</li>
  <li>Job canceled</li>
  </ul>

Two of the statuses are triggered automatically. The accepting applications status appears when the announcement is open, and reviewing applications status appears when the announcement closes. 

The staffing specialist is responsible for triggering the hiring complete or job canceled status through their Talent Acquisition System. Once a hiring manager selects a candidate to hire, the staffing specialist should move the announcement status to hiring complete. If the hiring manager makes no selection and the announcement is canceled, the staffing specialist should move the announcement status to job canceled. Timely status updates are important, so the job seeker is aware of where the job is in the hiring process.

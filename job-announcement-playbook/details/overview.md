<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__myth">
#### Myth: Job announcement titles are dictated by policy and must follow a specific format.

<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__container">
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do">
  <h4>OPM Policy</h4>
  <p>
    Organizational and functional titles do not replace official position titles, they complement them. Agencies may establish organizational and functional titles for internal administration, program management, or similar purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of organizational titles are branch chief or division chief. Examples of functional titles are chief of network management and director of policy development.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4>Impact</h4>
  <p>
    If job seekers don’t understand the job title, they are less likely to read the job announcement. For example, job titles that use grade levels or series numbers are confusing and can be misleading.
  </p>
  <p>
    Job announcements should include a job title that best describes the position, attracts candidates, and makes the job easier to find. For example, titling a job “Java Developer” instead of “APPSW” makes it easier for job seekers to understand.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

## Overview
The overview section is in the right-hand rail and gives an at-a-glance view of the job. This information appears on the search results card and entices a job seeker to open the job announcement. 
 
This section may contain the following: 
<ul>
  <li>Job status</li>
  <li>Announcement closing type:
    <ul>
      <li>Open and closing dates</li>
      <li>Application cut-off</li>
      <li>Open continuous</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Salary</li>
  <li>Pay scale and grade</li>
  <li>Location(s):
    <ul>
      <li>Vacancies</li>
      <li>Location within area</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Telework eligible</li>
  <li>Travel required</li>
  <li>Relocation expenses reimbursed</li>
  <li>Appointment type</li>
  <li>Work schedule</li>
  <li>Service type</li>
  <li>Promotional potential</li>
  <li>Job family (series)</li>
  <li>Supervisory status</li>
  <li>Security clearance</li>
  <li>Drug test</li>
  <li>Position sensitivity and risk</li>
  <li>Trust determination process</li>
  <li>Job announcement number</li>
  <li>Control number</li>
  </ul>
    
### Job status
Indicates where the job announcement is in the hiring process for job seekers. Includes one of the options:  

<ul>
  <li>Accepting applications</li>
  <li>Reviewing applications</li>
  <li>Hiring complete</li>
  <li>Job canceled</li>
  </ul>

Two of the statuses are triggered automatically. The accepting applications status appears when the announcement is open, and reviewing applications status appears when the announcement closes. 

The staffing specialist is responsible for triggering the hiring complete or job canceled status through their Talent Acquisition System. Once a hiring manager selects a candidate to hire, the staffing specialist should move the announcement status to hiring complete. If the hiring manager makes no selection and the announcement is canceled, the staffing specialist should move the announcement status to job canceled. Timely status updates are important, so the job seeker is aware of where the job is in the hiring process.

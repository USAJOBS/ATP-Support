    Job announcement guidelines
  </h2>
  <p class="usa-font-lead">
    We’ve created guidelines for each section of the job announcement including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What’s required in each section.</li>
    <li>What’s optional in each section.</li>
    <li>Recommended language to use.</li>
    <li>Do’s and don’ts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Problems we're trying to solve</h3>
  <h4>Eligibility</h4>
  <p>
    Job seekers struggle to understand if they're eligible for a job by looking at the job announcement.

We've created a list of hiring paths that can be selected for each job. See the <a href="{{ '/job-announcement-playbook/details/this-job-is-open-to/' | relative_url }}">This job is open to</a> section.
  
  <h4>Use the job summary to explain the job</h4>
  <p>
    Another problem we've addressed is the lack of summary in a job announcement, so job seekers understand whether to read the entire announcement. We have provided a place for agencies to communicate their mission and provide a link to <a href="{{ '/job-announcement-playbook/details/how-to-apply/#agency-contact-information---current-fields' | relative_url }}">learn more about the agency</a>. There are no fewer than three links to this information throughout the announcement. Using <a href="{{ '/job-announcement-playbook/details/summary/' | relative_url }}">agency contact information</a> section will free up the <a href="{{ '/job-announcement-playbook/details/summary/' | relative_url }}">job summary</a> to explain what the job seeker would be doing in that job.

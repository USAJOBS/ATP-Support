title: What is the Pathways Recent Graduate Talent Program?
---

Talent programs allow federal agencies to more easily search for and connect with vetted job candidates to fill your agency’s open permanent and temporary jobs.

Candidates in the Pathways Recent Graduates Talent Program have successfully completed all requirements of the Pathways Recent Graduate Program, which consists of a two-year professional development program at a federal agency. These candidates have proven themselves, but their originating agencies were unable to convert them to a full-time position, leaving them available to hire.

Agencies that do not currently participate in the Pathways Recent Graduate Program or do not fill positions in the competitive service are eligible to use this talent program, but should email [pathways@opm.gov](mailto:pathways@opm.gov) for more information before starting.

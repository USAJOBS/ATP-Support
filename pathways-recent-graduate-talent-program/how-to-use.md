An Agency Talent Portal (ATP) account is required to access talent programs. Email [recruiter-help@USAJOBS.gov](mailto:recruiter-help@USAJOBS.gov) to request an ATP account. Once logged in, navigate to Talent search and Talent programs to access the Pathways Recent Graduate Talent Program start searching for vetted talent.

This talent program features a searchable list of recent graduates that includes the following details:
* Name
* Location
* Education
* Current position
* Agency contact details
* Program expiration date

Agencies can use this information to search for and hire recent graduates from this talent program under non-competitive conversion eligibilities, or to contact them for targeted recruitment. 

Recent graduates in this talent program are eligible for conversion for a limited amount of time. Recent graduates must be converted by the end of their program period and any agency approved extension (up to 120 days after the candidate’s program completion date).

Your agency’s Pathways Program Officer (PPO) should track these deadlines and communicate with recent graduates in this talent program to ensure they understand all program due dates and requirements.

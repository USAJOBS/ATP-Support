### How do I reset my ATP password?

If you’ve forgotten your password or locked your account due to multiple incorrect password attempts, you can reset your password from the ATP Sign-In page. Select ‘Forgot your username or password’ and enter your federal email address into the text box. You will be sent a ‘Reset Password’ email. You can then create a new password.

### Why does my ATP account lock me out? When that happens, how do I unlock it?

ATP accounts are locked after 35 days of inactivity. If your account is locked due to inactivity, email your Agency Administrator and he/she can unlock your account. If you do not have an assigned Agency Administrator/do not know your Agency Administrator, email <a href="mailto:recruiter-help@usajobs.gov">recruiter-help@usajobs.gov</a> to request account access.
